```bash
npm i this.text

#### Under Development.

**Introduction to `this.text` in the context of Standardized Data Structuring**

**`this.text`**: While text is one of the most consumed web elements, its structure and format often vary. `this.text` seeks to standardize text content, ensuring consistency in how textual data is presented and subsequently consumed by machine learning models.

---------

### Installation:

Assuming you are in a Node.js environment and have the `this.text.js` in your project directory:

1. `npm init` - If you haven't already initialized your project as a Node application.
2. `npm install` - If you have any dependencies.

### Usage:

**index.js**

```js
javascriptCopy code
// Import the ThisText class from the module
const ThisText = require('./this.text.js');
// Instantiate the class with some text content
const textInstance = new ThisText("   Hello World!  This is a sample TEXT.  ");
// Call the standardize method to standardize the text
textInstance.standardize();
// Get and print the standardized text
console.log(textInstance.getStandardizedText());  // Outputs: "hello world! this is a sample text."
```

To run the code, execute:

```bash
node index.js
```

When you run the code using the example provided, the standardized text, which is trimmed and converted to lowercase, will be printed to the console.

Remember, the `standardize()` method in our example is rather simplistic. Depending on your project's specific requirements, you may want to incorporate more sophisticated text processing techniques.

### Conceptual Flow:

- [ ] Set up your context with [this.me.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.me)

- [ ] Create a neural network using [neurons.me](https://www.neurons.me).

- [ ] Define the data you'd like your neural network to recognize or process with [this.](https://www.neurons.me/this) modules.

- [ ] Use [this.be](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.be) to maintain a state or context, - watching over the [PixelGrid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.pixel) and any other states you define for example.

- [ ] Define desired status and handlers, [be.this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/be.this).

- [ ] Keep [i.mlearning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i.mlearning).

  # Context of Abstraction for Machine Learning Standardization

  Traditional web development elements, from images to audio, are designed mainly for display and interaction. But what if they could be seamlessly converted into standardized formats primed for machine learning? That's the vision behind the **this.** modules.

  An Introduction to the this. JavaScript Library: Standardizing Web Development Elements for Machine Learning.

  ## Principles Behind the this. Library:

  - ### **Abstraction for ML:**

   The library's core principle is to abstract traditional web elements so that they're immediately primed for machine learning. It's about viewing web content not just as data but as structured, consistent, and standardized data.

  - ### **Built on Web Standards:** 

  Rooted in JavaScript, the this. library builds upon public web development standards. The aim is to ensure that developers remain within familiar territories, even as they venture into the world of machine learning.

  - ### **Open and Collaborative:** 

  The this. library champions open standards. By leveraging public web standards, it invites collaboration, hoping to create a community that continually refines and enhances the bridge between web development and machine learning.
